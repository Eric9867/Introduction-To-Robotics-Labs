# ROB301 Lab Projects
These are the lab projects for ROB301 class of fall 2022. All have been implemented on TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi robots.
These labs were completed in a team of two. `Team: Eric Lefort and Gurpreet Mukker`

## Lab 1: basic control using ROS
* connected to the TurtleBot
* controlled using ROS teleop (telemetry)
* wrote and used Python ROS nodes 
* controlled actuators
* analyzed discrepancies between model and performance due to input error and odometry error 

## Lab 2: pose-to-pose control without feedback
* control along straight-line path
* control with waypoints and straight-line segments
* control using curved path

## Lab 3: path-following robot
* used camera to determine relative position of robot to marked line
* implemented bang-bang controller
* implemented P, PI, and PID controllers
* designed and tested PID controller on various types of tracks
* raced robot against classmates
    * completed course in 1:07
    * first-place finish

## Lab 4: localization and state estimation using an extended Kalman filter
* implement an extended Kalman filter for one-dimensional localization
* tested the filter on an idealized robotic mail-delivery task



## Final Project: Bayesian Localization: Particle Filtering
